            <h1>This is the big heading, we'll talk about whitespace</h1>

            <p>This is a paragraph about white space.          The browser will treat a block of whitespace(spaces, tabs, new lines, etc) as a single blank space. 
                In order to add spaces to a page for instance you use &amp;nbsp; There will be four of those after this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and before this.
                This is an example of <b>character entities</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>This is another paragraph about the big heading.
                You can't just hit enter to go to a new line on the webpage. You must use <br> tags <br> for this.
