I keep simple projects I work on for learning and teaching


I could use some more comments I'm sure but I hope to utilize many techniques in each project. Right now I plan on saving all HTML/CSS/JS code in one .html file to make it easy for someone learning to try it out. It will probably make many files a bit lengthy though so feel free to separate the Code into multiple files.
